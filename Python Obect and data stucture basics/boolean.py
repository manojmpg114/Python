#quick look at booleans (self explanatory from java)

#booleans in python require first letter capitialzied 
print(type(True))

print(type(False))

#check for equaity with double equals == returns booleans 

print(1 == 1)

print(1<2)
print(1>2)

b = None #None is captital N and this is used as a place holder so we don't get a message saying that this is not defined

#in python logical comparators are written out
# && = "and" in python
#you can also use parenthesis to separate the conditions 
# || in java is just "or" in python
#should always focus on readability in the code

#"not" keyword provides the opposite impact like not (1==1) returns a False
